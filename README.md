# Question Serving

_A tool to help independent educators deliver tests and practice questions to students._

This project is built with

-   **M**ongoDB
-   **E**xpress
-   **R**eact
-   **N**ode Js

Prior to this project I was fluent in Javascript but a complete newcomer to Mongo, Express, React, and Node. I mainly worked with Vue for frontend and Flask for backend.

I primarily embarked on this project to learn new technologies, but it also fufills a need I have as a tutor.

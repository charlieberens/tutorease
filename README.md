# Question Serving
_A tool to help independent educators deliver tests and practice questions to students._

As the name implies this project is built with
- **M**ongoDB
- **E**xpress
- **R**eact
- **N**ode Js

Prior to this project I was fluent in Javascript but a complete newcomer to Mongo, Express, React, and Node. I mainly worked with Vue and Flask for backend. 

This is primarily a project for me to learn new technologies, but it also solves fufills a need I have as a tutor.

Teachers/Tutors can create problems and assign them to their students. Simple as that.

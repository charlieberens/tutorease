# Question Serving
A tool to help independent educators deliver tests and practice questions to students.

As the name implies this project is built with MERN:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node Js

Prior to this project I was fluent in Javascript but a complete newcomer to Mongo, Express, React, and Node. I mainly worked with Vue and Flask for backend. 

This is primarily a project for me to learn new technologies, but it also solves fufills a need I have as a tutor.

Teachers/Tutors can create problems and assign them to their students. Simple as that.
